* The genetics of niche-specific behavioral tendencies in an adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes
  * "Many of these factors, and especially adaptation and speciation, are key components of the evolutionary phenomenon of adaptive radiation, that is, the rapid evolution of an array of species through adaptive diversification into a variety of ecological niches."
  * "Key feature of adaptive radiation is that new species emerge rapidly from a common ancestor as a consequence of their adaptation to distinct ecological niches, resulting in a correlation between adaptive phenotypes and the environment."

[Hybrid speciation driven by multilocus introgression of ecological traits](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07263-w). Nature, pp.1-7.
  * "Hybridization allows adaptations to be shared among lineages and may trigger the evolution of new species." ... "The question of how new species originate and adapt to environments
is fundamental to evolutionary biology. Hybridization might have a key role in establishing barriers to gene flow by creating new allelic combinations."
  * "How populations transition to new fitness peaks remains an unanswered question, but adaptive introgression provides a possible route."

  * "Adaptive radiation is driven by ecological opportunity, whereby newly accessible niches provide potential for diversification."
  * "Genomic analysis suggests that color pattern diversity is generated by different combinations of alleles at a few genes with large effect."
  * "The historically high effective population size of hamlets provides a rich genomic substrate from which hybridization can rapidly assemble new phenotypic variation. This attribute is emerging as the common denominator to a variety of radiations on land and in the sea."
